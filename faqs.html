                        <br>Apple cider vinegar has become popular as a natural remedy for a variety of ailments. Can it cause diarrhea, or might it be used to treat it? <br>
                        </h5>

                        <p style="font-family: body-text; max-width: 75%; color: white; text-align: justify">
                        Research has found that apple cider vinegar has antimicrobial properties and can destroy E. coli bacteria, which can cause food poisoning and are responsible for many cases of diarrhea. However, apple cider vinegar might also destroy some types of bacteria in the gut that are good for digestion. This could irritate the gut and lead to diarrhea. This research was carried out in a laboratory, with apple cider vinegar applied directly to bacteria, so the results are likely to be different in people. There is also some evidence that apple cider vinegar delays the emptying of the stomach. If a person has diarrhea, apple cider vinegar could slow down the digestive process, which may give the stool time to harden before being expelled. More research needs to be done into the possible benefits of apple cider vinegar, as it is not clear whether it is safe to use as a treatment for diarrhea. <br>

                        <br>What causes dark nipples?<br>
                        </h5>

                        <p style="font-family: body-text; max-width: 75%; color: white; text-align: justify">
                        A person's breasts will change over time due to natural events that include puberty and pregnancy. The nipples themselves do not change color, but the circular area of skin that surrounds each nipple, which is known as the areola, may change. Most of the time, color changes in the areola are benign. However, there are occasions when a change in the color of the nipples needs medical attention. Causes of darkening nipples include:<br><br>

                        • oral contraceptives <br>
                        • puberty <br>
                        • pregnancy <br>
                        • hairs around the nipples <br>
                        • menstruation <br>
                        • breast-feeding <br>
                        • cancer <br>
                        </p>

                        <br>Can I get rid of a mole by myself?<br>
                        </h5>

                        <p style="font-family: body-text; max-width: 75%; color: white; text-align: justify">
                        Most people have between 10 and 40 moles on their body. They are usually harmless but can sometimes become cancerous. If a person has a cancerous mole, then medical insurance will typically cover the cost of removal. However, insurance may not include the removal of benign moles, which is why some people may consider home remedies. Others may try home remedies because they do not want to see a doctor about a normal mole. Although some people believe that home remedies can work, no formal studies have been carried out on their safety, effectiveness, or potential side effects. It is essential that anyone who is considering removing a mole using home remedies talks to a dermatologist (skin doctor) beforehand. <br><br>
